**User Stories:**

1. As a shift worker, I want the system to automatically claim available shifts on my behalf, so that I don't miss out on work opportunities.
2. As a shift worker, I want to be able to manually start and stop the shift claiming automation, so that I have control over when the system claims shifts for me.
3. As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and performance of the Shift Claiming Automation System, so that I can ensure its reliability and take action if issues arise.
4. As a developer, I want the system to handle timeouts and rate limiting gracefully, so that it can recover from transient failures and avoid unnecessary resource usage.

**Design Patterns and Cloud Patterns:**

1. Serverless Architecture: Utilize Google Cloud Functions to build a serverless architecture, enabling automatic scaling and reducing operational overhead.
2. Event-Driven Architecture: Leverage Cloud Pub/Sub to decouple the Start/Stop Function from the Shift Claiming Function, allowing for flexible triggering and communication between components.
3. Scheduler Pattern: Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger the Shift Claiming Function based on a dynamic invocation schedule, enabling efficient resource utilization.
4. Retry Pattern: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient failures and improve system resilience.
5. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Implement a circuit breaker pattern to handle timeouts and rate limiting, preventing cascading failures and allowing the system to gracefully degrade.
6. Caching Pattern: Utilize caching mechanisms, such as Cloud Memorystore (Redis) or in-memory caching, to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the Firestore database.
7. Asynchronous Processing: Leverage Golang's concurrency features, such as goroutines, to process shift claims asynchronously and improve system throughput.
